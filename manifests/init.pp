# Install shorewall packages and perform fundamental configuration.

# Attributes:
#
#  * `v4_only` (boolean; optional; default `false`)
#
#     Set this to `true` if you don't want shorewall to be configured to
#     manage IPv6 firewall rules at *all*.  This should only be enabled if
#     you are actively IPv6-hostile: on a machine with no IPv6 connectivity,
#     managing IPv6 rules will have no adverse effect; on the other hand, if
#     you somehow end up with IPv6 connectivity but you're not managing your
#     IPv6 firewall rules, you can accidentally end up with a gaping goatse
#     of a firewall.
